## Content
The content monitored is the relative investment of each community in the work of other communities among the Wikipedia platform. 
To this aim, a database of articles is established and used to determine the cross-project contributions of influent members of the Wikipedia community.

## Hypothesis 
1- We believe that this work will show an above-average group behaviour of political contents (as opposed to non-political contents, such as sports). 
2- We believe that theses contributors tend to edit articles advocating both FOR and AGAINST most topics (e.g. feminist rights).
3- We believe that the political contributors are mostly left-leaning, politically. 

## Future Work
A paper could be published shortly to show the results of all tests conducted.
